# Xplore
Xplore is an interactive map-based mobile application that connects users to nearby user-hosted events

## Requirements
CocoaPods: https://cocoapods.org/
  
  CocoaPods lets you install dependencies into the project in the form of pod files. You will need this to install both MapBox and Firebase.

In order to view the custom-made map, you will have the install MapBox: https://www.mapbox.com/install/ios/ Make sure to choose the Cocoapods method.

The Firebase dependency allows us to securely track user login information. Download information is here: https://firebase.google.com/docs/ios/setup

Note that a lot of these files are already downloaded into GitHub except for 1 Mapbox file.
